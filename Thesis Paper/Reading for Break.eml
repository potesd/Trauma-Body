Reading and Film Response

The way that Diana Newton utilizes images of sounds, like cassettes
rolling, being put into cameras, etc... are incredibly visually
stimulating. The documentation of a personal family matter that impacts
families nationwide using this very public medium.
Some of the key moments of editing that struck me were the moments in which
the sound effects are visualized by short clips of of what is making the
sounds. such as the waves crashing or the moments of the sounds of
cassettes spinning. These visual effects remind me of in Another Look which
begins with a quote from Dziga Vertov.

"I am Kino-eye, I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, show you the world as
only I can see it."

In this post colonial, post modern experimental film-making, it is the
perspective of the other, the colonized, the objectified, the downtrodden,
that allows experimental film-making to enhance and even change visual
culture and programming. As a piece of ethnographic film-making, Ties that
Bind works in this system of culture shifting. The author of Another Look
even says that their objective in the book, is to demonstrate how
filmmakers have experimented with the "otherness" of reality, and what are
the implications of such to cultural memory.
This directly speaks to me as an artist because it almost word for word
follows the purpose of my thesis. Those who experience a reality that is
different, or "other" to the cultural norm, are often cast out, looked down
upon, and otherwise oppressed. It's hard to put into words how difficult it
can be to put into words an experience that you know is unique, or at least
not nomative to cultural codes.

My thesis is an attempt to use film-making, stage performance, and MR
technology, to explain a unique, and misunderstood perspective to a crowd
of people who would otherwise never be able to access it. The specific
experience that I plan on working to showcase, is that of a UFO abduction,
a traumatic and often ridiculed experience.
